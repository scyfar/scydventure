# Description

Scydventure is a heavily opinionated modpack.
It has no specific topic and tries to make Minecraft more enjoyable but not overpowered.

# Release

The release unfortunately is not yet fully automated.

An important note for releases is, that the leading information comes from the `pack.toml`.
The `./scripts/release.py` automatically gathers the required information.

This modpack uses [`packwiz`][packwiz] to manage and export the files.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, this pack focuses on distributing via [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/) and for the
> [NeoForge](https://neoforged.net/) mod loader only.
> Other platforms and loaders _may_ follow. No promises though.

1. Ensure the `./packwiz/[...]/[...]/.modlist.json` is up-to-date with the new versions entries
2. Run the [attribution script](./scripts/attribution-data.py) and add the data to the
   [docs](./docs/src/attribution.md)
3. Run the [packwiz script to add mods](./scripts/packwiz-add-mods.py)
   - Dependencies must be added to `.modlist.json`, so they should not be installed with `packwiz`
   - **This script deletes everything from the `mods` folder**
4. Make manual changes, if necessary (e.g. set the `preserve` flag in `index.toml`)
5. Run the [release script](./scripts/release.py)
   - The `<new_version>` argument will be used as Git tag
6. Add information to the [version discussion](https://github.com/scyfar/scydventure/discussions/categories/versions)
   on GitHub
7. Optional for local import: Run the [env change script](./scripts/client-env-required.py)

The `release.py` script is called with the `<new_version>` as only argument:

```shell
python ./scripts/release.py 0.1.0-alpha_1.21.1_neoforge
```

> [!NOTE]
> The release type is determined from the Git tag name.
>
> - `draft` will cause the release to be marked as a draft and nothing will be uploaded to Modrinth.
> - `alpha`, `beta` and `rc` will cause the release to be marked as pre-release and uploaded as
>   with the respective type to Modrinth. `beta` and `rc` will both be considered a beta release.
> - If no suffix exists, it is considered a regular release and will be also uploaded to Modrinth as
>   such.

# Scripts

Scripts prefixed with `_` are used in automation scripts and should not be used manually.

## Add mods

> [!CAUTION]
> This script will delete all files in `<source>/mods`.

Mods must be listed in a file named `.modlist.json` in the respective packwiz version directory.
Each JSON object must have a key `url` with a valid URL to the mod or to a specific version at the
Modrinth website.

Dependencies must be also added to this file, despite `packwiz` potentially resolving them. This is
due to the other use in the `./scripts/attribution-data.py` script.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Unfortunately, packwiz does not allow for silent dependency installation, and it does not properly
> detect if it is already added.
> Therefore, this script requires manual intervention.

The script `./scripts/packwiz-add-mods.py` will add the mods listed in the `.modlist.json` file.
It requires the `<source>` as only argument:

```shell
python ./scripts/packwiz-add-mods.py ./packwiz/1.21.1/neoforge/
```

## Export mrpack

The script `./scripts/export-mrpack.py` will export the version provided and create the
`mrpack` in the target directory. It requires the `<source>` and `<target>` as arguments:

```shell
python ./scripts/export-mrpack.py ./packwiz/1.21.1/neoforge/ ./target/
```

`packwiz` will reprect the sidedness of the mod configuration and produce a proper `env` config
in the modrinth JSON. This leads to an import issue, where sever sided mods will not be imported by
the Modrinth App.

To fix this, the script `./scripts/client-env-required.py` can be used to change all `env.client` to
`required`. It requires the `<source>` and `<target>` as arguments:

```shell
python ./scripts/client-env-required.py ./target/filname.mrpack ./target/filename-required.mrpack`
```

The new `<target>` can be the same name and it will overwrite the old file.

> [!NOTE]
> The change to `required` is currently in line with the
> [app export](https://github.com/modrinth/code/blob/827e3ec0a0a7149709df4d292add222c490e8318/packages/app-lib/src/api/profile/mod.rs#L860C1-L865C65).

## Attribution data

The script `./scripts/attribution-data.py` will use the `.modlist.json` to get attribution data and
print a Markdown table row for each entry.
This table may not be completely filled, and certain fields can be substituted in the JSON file.

This file must contain all mods including the dependencies for a complete list in the documentation.
For details please see
[the documentation](https://scyfar.github.io/scydventure/dev-notes.html#modlistjson).
It requires the `<source>` as only argument:

```shell
python ./scripts/attribution-data.py ./packwiz/1.21.1/neoforge/
```

The resulting table can be seen [here](https://scyfar.github.io/scydventure/attribution.html).

# Resource Packs

The pack does not ship with resource packs but enables them if mods have built-in ones.
If an `options.txt` exists prior to installing the modpack, the resource packs must be manually
enabled.

# Attribution

Thanks to all the mod, library and tool developers. A special shoutout to the ones providing
software [used for this modpack](https://scyfar.github.io/scydventure/attribution.html).

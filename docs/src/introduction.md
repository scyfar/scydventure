Scydventure is a heavily opinionated modpack.
It has no specific topic and tries to make Minecraft more enjoyable but not overpowered.

It features a wide variety of mods that enhance the gameplay without requiring endless
chain-crafting or allow you to obtain creative flight within the first couple of in-game days.

Scydventure tries to balance the additional abilities, tools and machines in a way, so they help
with progressing through the pack without introducing shortcuts and allow getting overpowered too
quick (if at all).

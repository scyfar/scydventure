# Questions and Answers

## Why only Modrinth?

I decided to start to create this modpack on the [Modrinth][modrinth] loader and since I am not very
experienced, I just stick with it and don't add additional platforms.

This may change in the future.

## Why not "Just Enough Items (JEI)"?

JEI requires the [Configured](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/configured) mod for
configuration and that is not available on [Modrinth][modrinth].

# Scydventure - Changelog

<!-- BEGIN NEXT_1.21.1_neoforge -->

## What's Changed (`NEXT_1.21.1_neoforge`)

- The mod [Sophisticated Storage](https://modrinth.com/mod/sophisticated-storage) was replaced in
favor of [Tom's Simple Storage Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/toms-storage). Tom's does fit better
and provides the desired crafting grid with all the storage attached. Additionally, it provides a
good way to get a wireless terminal.

- The mod [ExtraSounds Next](https://modrinth.com/mod/extrasoundsforge) was replaced by the mod
[Sounds](https://modrinth.com/mod/sound) for better customization and better overall sound quality.

- The mod [Short Circuit](https://modrinth.com/mod/short-circuit) was removed as it was not providing
the easy compacted redstone interaction as hoped.

- The mod [NetherPortalFix](https://modrinth.com/mod/netherportalfix) was added to better connect the
nether portals (even in single player mode).

- Add `biomesoplenty:pasture` as pollen biome for [Subtle Effects](https://modrinth.com/mod/subtle-effects).

All mods have been updated to their latest version as of 2025-04-04 and NeoForge was updated to
`21.1.143`.

## What's Changed (`0.1.2-alpha_1.21.1_neoforge`)

This is a technical release.

No changes were made to the actual mod-pack. This release fixes the installation issue where mods
targeted for the server only would not be properly installed.

## What's Changed (`0.1.1-alpha_1.21.1_neoforge`)

This is a technical release.

No changes were made to the actual mod-pack, but additional information is added to the metadata:

- A new `*_singleplayer.mrpack` asset is attached to versions. This is required since otherwise
  server side mods will not be installed on local installations. Use this if you run the pack
  entirely on your system and don't have a dedicated server. See
  [this discussion](https://github.com/scyfar/scydventure/discussions/25)
- Dependency information is now added to each version, so it is immediately clear which mods are
  included in the mod-pack.

## What's Changed (`0.1.0-alpha_1.21.1_neoforge`)

This is the initial alpha release of Scydventure.

The most notable changes apart from the inception are:

- The day and night cycles have been changed. The day should be noticeably longer.
- With access to Netherbrick, a new tier for furnaces unlocks for faster smelting.
- The world is much more lively, atmospheric and interesting to explore, but also more dangerous.
- To guard against the dangers, additional armor and weaponry is available.
- Adventures can be extended thanks to backpacks and storage systems can be as functional as they
  should be
- More enchantments introduce an extended progression and make the game more enjoyable

# Scydventure - Changelog

<!-- BEGIN 0.1.1-alpha_1.21.1_neoforge -->

## What's Changed (`0.1.1-alpha_1.21.1_neoforge`)

This is a technical release.

No changes were made to the actual modpack, but additional information is added to the metadata:

- A new `*_singleplayer.mrpack` asset is attached to versions. This is required since otherwise
  server side mods will not be installed on local installations. Use this if you run the pack
  entirely on your system and don't have a dedicated server. See
  [this discussion](https://github.com/scyfar/scydventure/discussions/25)
- Dependency information is now added to each version, so it is immediately clear which mods are
  included in the modpack.

## What's Changed (`0.1.0-alpha_1.21.1_neoforge`)

This is the initial alpha release of Scydventure.

The most notable changes apart from the inception are:

- The day and night cycles have been changed. The day should be noticeably longer.
- With access to Netherbrick, a new tier for furnaces unlocks for faster smelting.
- The world is much more lively, atmospheric and interesting to explore, but also more dangerous.
- To guard against the dangers, additional armor and weaponry is available.
- Adventures can be extended thanks to backpacks and storage systems can be as functional as they
  should be
- More enchantments introduce an extended progression and make the game more enjoyable

This is the initial alpha release of Scydventure.

The most notable changes apart from the inception are:

- The day and night cycles have been changed. The day should be noticeably longer.
- With access to Netherbrick, a new tier for furnaces unlocks for faster smelting.
- The world is much more lively, atmospheric and interesting to explore, but also more dangerous.
- To guard against the dangers, additional armor and weaponry is available.
- Adventures can be extended thanks to backpacks and storage systems can be as functional as they
  should be
- More enchantments introduce an extended progression and make the game more enjoyable
